ActiveWatch (AW) is a set of Java modules for finite indexing of text.
It represents text items as M-dimensional numerical vectors, where M is on
the order of 10‚Å¥. AW notably employs a statistically scaled similarity
measure between pairs of vectors as an alternative to the cosine similarity
of Gerard Salton.

An AW index set consists of finitely many user-selected full words plus
finitely many high-frequency English word fragments. Fragmentary
indices allow an approximation of indexing by every word. For example,
if the word CONFABULATE is unknown as a full-word index key, we can still
recognize its overlapping fragments: CONF, NFA, FAB, ABU, ULAT, and LATE.

Indexing by fragments will be noisy, but can still be quite effective for
comparing the content of entire text items. Limiting an index set to three
or found thousand selected whole words, five or six thousand selected word
fragments, and a few thousand other indices gives us more manageable
descriptions of text content and simplifies statistical computations.

In particular, we can more reliably estimate the probability of a given
index key showing up in a text item and thereby calculate the probability
of a particular inner product score occurring by chance in item vectors.
This will define the parameters of a noise distribution for scaling inner
product similarity scores to make them easier to interpret.

AW scores similarity by the the number of standard deviations that a raw
inner product falls above or below the mean of a noise distribution.
This noise will be roughly Gaussian; an AW scaled similarity of 3 standard
deviations would be significant at about p = .003. With actual text data,
we usually will see scaled similarity above 5 standard deviations.

Some index tuning is needed to achieve this kind of performance. This will
mainly involve adjustments of the whole-word index keys defined by a user
for particular target text data. We can also improve fragmentary indexing
in general by selecting the fragments more carefully and making them
subsume more frequent shorter fragments.

The first version of AW was written in C around 1982 and was employed for
information discovery in unfamiliar text data. The current Java version
dates back to around 1999, but has some recent tweaks in its linguistic
analysis and its inclusion of 4- and 5-letter word fragments for indexings,
along with the 2- and 3-letter fragments employed employed previously. 

The modules included in the AW GitHub repository mainly provide support for
simple clustering of text items by content. These are organized functionally
by their Java package identifications. The Java code was originally written on
Apple home computers running versions 7.*, 8.*, or 9.* of the Macintosh OS.
This was when Java was still a somewhat new programming language.

Java AW eventually evolved to support all kinds of statistical natural
processing, but this GitHub repository includes only a small subset of modules
for supporting automatic clustering of text items by content. This should give
you a good overall idea of what you can accomplish with AW finite indexing and
statistically scaled similarity between pairs of text items.

To build a basic AW clustering capability, just run the 'build' shell script in
the AW repository. A complicated makefile is unnecessary. You just need to
know which classes with main() modules have to be compiled. Java should then
be able to trace the dependencies in the source code and find the necessary
files in the AW repository file hierarchy. 

AW software is free for all uses and is released under BSD licensing.
