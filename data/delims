; the finite automaton will be defined in terms
; of its transitions (arcs), to be specified in
; standard input according the format:
;                      x y t a pat
; where
;  x   is the beginning state
;  y   is the ending state
;  t   is an event type on a delimiter match
;  a   is an action (. + ?)
;  pat is a string delimiter pattern
;
; (1) states are integer values from 0 to (NOS-1)
;     determining what sets of delimiters should
;     be matched
; (2) event types are NIL, SOH, SBJ, SOT, EOT, EOM
; (3) possible actions are
;      +  go to the next line
;      .  stay at current line
;      ?  force a fatal error
;
